XRPG. Lots of fun. `;)`

## Setting Up

You'll need the following to run this:

* Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
* TypeScript 2.1.6 (don't roll your eyes at me)
* Node.js / npm
  * From NPM:
    * `typescript`
    * `tsc`
    * `live-server` (recommended, makes debugging easy)
* Git (and GitHub for Windows/Mac for easy sync)

Clone the repo and get to work!

## Running It

I recommend navigating to `/src` and, after running `npm install -g live-server` if you haven't already, run this command:

```bash
    live-server --entry-file=/
```

This makes live-server play nice with Angular routing and makes the SPA nice and warm. :)
